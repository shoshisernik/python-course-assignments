promts given to copilot (model in the visual studio) to create program for area of circle

write a code that calculates the area of a circle. write it in python 3.13 and please make it so the user can input values into the comand line

"if_name_=="main_" where we try the entire function, but if the value inputed is not valid, it will print ("not valid number for radius. please enter a valid number and try again"). this is the except ValueError command




PCR extension time calculator:
this code will calculate the amount of time needed for the extension step of a PCR reaction that someone is planning. 
It will ask for the extension rate of the enzyme and the length of the desired PCR product. 
for the GUI version, I will include a dropdown menu of certain PCR mixes, so that the person does not need to know the rate, only the name of the product. There will also be the option to manually input a rate.


prompts given to copilot for interesting program: 
for the input version:

write me a program in python 3.13 that calculates the extension time for a PCR reaction. This is a simple rate question., where the user would need to input the rate of the enzyme being used (in base pairs per second) and the length of the desired PCR product. I would like this code to be interactive, so the user will input the numbers once the code is running and asks for the values

for the command line version:
