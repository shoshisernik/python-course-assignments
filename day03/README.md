This program calculates the elongation time for a PCR reaction depending on the polymerase being used and the desired length of PCR product. 

The test itself has the dependancies listed in the toml file. To run the original code that it is testing, you must also copy the code or clone my repository (https://github.com/shoshisernik/python-course-assignments.git). The GUI of the code has the dependency "tkinter". So, I included this dependency in the toml file.




Questions Asked to AI: 
I asked AI how I would go about testing, and then read through the examples that it gave. I then tried to copy the functions, but with my scripts.


I then asked "please write a code that tests the file "PCR extension time calculator_cmdline.py" that is in this same day03 folder. Please use pytest. please start this code with the import command that imports the code it is testing"

"i just changed the name of the file it is testing. can you please update the code? also, please start the code: import PCR extension time calculator_cmdline_copy.py"
