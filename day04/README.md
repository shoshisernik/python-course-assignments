Introduction:
this code provides a quick way to determine genome location for any drosophila gene in FlyBase.

Using the UI code, fill in your gene of interest and the folder destination. 

Then, run the file "code_geneloc_flybase.py".
This code will use the information provided in the "UI_geneloc_flybase.py" file. 

To run the entire code, open a terminal in the day04 folder and type in:
python UI_geneloc_flybase.py
or, open the code in visual studio and press the "run" button at the top right of the window. 

You will need to install 2 dependencies. To do so, type into your terminal:
